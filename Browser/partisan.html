                What do the partisan scores tell us?<br>
                Based on the news media you consume, having a negative score indicates consuming more 'left wing' content.
                Conversely, a positive score is indicative of 'right wing' content, and scores close to zero indicate 'centrist' content.

                <br><br>
                What does content reliability tell us?<br>
                High = Factual news coverage, attention to detail<br>
                Mixed = Factual content quality varies per author on the site<br>
                Low = Little attention to fact-checking and/or propagation of false news.
