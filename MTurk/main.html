      <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
      <h3>What is this research about?</h3>
      In this research, we will explore individuals’ political views through news media accessed in their browsing history. Participants will be asked to install a web browser extension for either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. You will be prompted to submit your browsing history for use. Please be advised that a minimum 2-month browsing history is required for this study. Furthermore, no data revealing your personal identity, IP address, or any other sensitive information will be collected and stored.
      <br>
      It is important to note that under no circumstances will we apply any judgement concerning your opinions.
      <br>


        <h3>Detailed description of collected data</h3>
        Your browsing history pertaining to news media visits is aggregated to measure your approximate political leanings.
         <br>
        <h3>What are the possible benefits?</h3>
        With this study, we would like to generate new insights with regard to how to determine an individual’s political viewpoint in an automated manner through their news viewing trends, and how an individual responds to news media with differing viewpoints.
        <br>
        By participating in this study and allowing us to record your response you will contribute to research that aims to use technology to facilitate critical thinking, civil discourse, and bi-partisan cooperation. As a reward for your participation, you will receive $10AUD upon completion of the study. This study does not expect an immediate benefit to the participants other than the monetary compensation.
        <br>
        <h3>Will I hear about the results of this project?</h3>
        If you are interested in the results of this project, you can leave us your email address at the end of the study during the exit survey. We will then contact you if the results of this study have been finalised in a peer-reviewed publication.
        <br>
        <h3>What will happen to information about me?</h3>
        We have taken all possible steps to protect your anonymity and the confidentiality of your data. Your name and contact details will be kept in a separate, password-protected computer file separated from any data that you supply. Your browsing history will become completely anonymized, and only data related to news media visits will be retained. In any published work (such as in an academic paper), you will be referred to by a pseudonym. We will remove any references to personal information that might allow someone to guess your identity. The data will be kept securely for five years after the last date of publication, before being destroyed.
